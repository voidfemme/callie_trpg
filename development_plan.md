The Following is a generated project plan by chatgpt. Obviously we should discuss it and 
remove/add what is needed.


1. **Conceptualization and Storyboarding (1-2 months)**: This is where you'll flesh out your game's story, characters, and world. You'll also decide on the game mechanics, level design, and overall structure of the game. This phase will likely involve a lot of brainstorming and sketching.

2. **System Design (3-4 months)**: This phase involves designing the core systems of your game, such as the combat system, AI, inventory system, dialogue system, etc. You'll also need to decide on the technical aspects of your game, such as the game engine and programming languages you'll use.

3. **Art and Sound Design (3-4 months)**: This phase involves creating the visual and auditory assets for your game. This includes character and environment art, UI design, sound effects, and music. You may need to hire or collaborate with artists and sound designers for this phase.

4. **Prototyping (2-3 months)**: In this phase, you'll create a basic version of your game that includes the core gameplay mechanics. This will allow you to test and refine these mechanics before you invest too much time in development.

5. **Level Design and Story Implementation (4-6 months)**: This phase involves creating the levels for your game and implementing the story. This includes designing the layout of each level, placing enemies and items, and scripting story events.

6. **Coding and Integration (4-6 months)**: This phase involves coding the game mechanics and integrating the art and sound assets into the game. You'll also need to code the UI and any other systems you've designed.

7. **Testing and Polishing (2-3 months)**: In this phase, you'll playtest your game extensively to find and fix bugs. You'll also refine the game mechanics, art, and sound based on feedback from playtesters.

8. **Marketing and Release (1-2 months)**: This phase involves promoting your game to generate interest and then releasing it to the public. You may need to create a website, trailer, and press kit for your game. You'll also need to decide on a price and distribution platform for your game.

Please note that these are rough estimates and the actual timeline may vary depending on various factors such as the complexity of your game, the size of your team, and your level of experience. Also, these phases are not strictly linear and may overlap. For example, you might start creating art assets while you're still designing the game systems.
