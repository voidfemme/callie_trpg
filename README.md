# Tactical Role-Playing Game (TRPG)

This project aims to develop a tactical role-playing game (TRPG) where players can engage in strategic battles on a grid-based map. The code provided serves as the starting point for the project, outlining the basic classes and their functionalities.

## Classes and Functionality

1. **Cursor**: The `Cursor` class represents a cursor used for selecting positions or targets in the game. It has attributes for storing the current position and target. The class provides methods to determine if the cursor represents a player or an enemy.

2. **Menu**: The `Menu` class represents the game menu. It currently accepts parameters such as the player, enemy, and cursor. However, no specific functionality has been implemented in the provided code.

3. **Screen**: The `Screen` class represents the game screen. It contains an attribute `frame`, which could potentially hold the graphical or textual representation of the current game frame.

4. **Square**: The `Square` class represents a square on the game map. It has an attribute to store the type of terrain present on the square. The class provides a method to check if the square is occupied by any unit.

5. **Unit**: The `Unit` class represents a game unit. It contains attributes such as name, position, hit points (hp), attack, defense, and speed. The class provides methods to check if the unit has moved or acted.

## Project Status

At this stage, the project has defined the initial set of classes required for the TRPG. However, the provided code lacks a complete implementation and does not demonstrate the interactions between the classes. Additional functionality, such as movement, combat mechanics, game rules, and user interface, needs to be implemented to make the game playable.

## Next Steps

To progress with the TRPG project, consider the following next steps:

1. Implement the game mechanics, including unit movement, combat, and turn-based gameplay.
2. Develop the game map by incorporating squares with different terrain types.
3. Enhance the menu functionality to provide options such as unit actions, saving, loading, and game management.
4. Implement the user interface to display the game screen, units, menus, and other relevant information.
5. Design and create additional classes and systems as per the game requirements, such as AI for enemy units, item management, and character progression.

Remember to plan and iterate on your design, test your code, and incorporate player feedback to create an enjoyable and immersive TRPG experience.
